        <h2>Stunning Winter Scenery</h2>
        <p>
            Bergen is a beautiful city, and its beauty is especially amplified in the winter. You know, they call is the city between seven mountains because that's what it is, surrounded by mountains that make up for the beauty of Bergen, and fjords such as the Byfjorden and its magnificent forests like Kanadaskogen. The winter air and the views are top-tier when exploring the city mountains, Fløyen or Ulriken.

        <h2>Charming Atmospheres</h2>
        <p>
            When it gets close to Christmas times, their famous Julemarked emerges at the Festplassen where you can buy festive items  and good snacks. The city streets are filled with cozy festive lights, it's a joy to walk in the streets. It's a crime, at least to me, to not enjoy hot cocoa or mulled wine at the local cafees. Or to not walk past Bryggen and the beautiful christmas decorations and trees. I will make sure you go to jail if not!!!

        <h2>Activities and Adventures</h2>
        <p>
            Bergen is considered a heavy raining city across the year, it's generally considered a milder city in the snow-season. A professor from the University of Bergen is famous for always skiing to work whenever he can, from Bryggen, past Torgallmenningen and to Nygård to get to work. There are some fine skiing tracks at both Fløyen and Ulriken that are easily accessible. And if you are really, really lucky you might get the chance to spot northern lights whenever the skies are clear at Fløyen or a less light-polluted area.
